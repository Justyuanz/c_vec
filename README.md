# C Vector Library

A simple, reusable dynamic array (vector) implementation in C. This library provides a flexible data structure.

## Purpose

This is a personal reimplementation based on the subject provided in [juliuskoskela/c-vec](https://github.com/juliuskoskela/c-vec).  
The goal is to have a lightweight, dependency-free vector library for use in future C projects.
